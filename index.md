## Bio
I am a Mechatronics Engineer with experience building software and embedded products, currently focussed on artificial intelligence and machine learning. 

### Machine Learning
I am interested in understanding and explaining machine learning concepts from first principles. As research remains the dominant source of impactful innovation in machine learning, my objective is to landmark research. Specifically, I want to synthesize periodically the advances in different branches of ML as cornerstones of progress to be easily referenced by the broad community of researchers and practitioners. This is a large task, in an even larger field, and so I look forward to collaborating with others on this mission.  

*If my work, vision, or background resonate with you, please reach out to have a chat/collaborate.*
